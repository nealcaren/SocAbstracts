abstract = '''Can protest influence elections? We contribute to an important and emerging literature on the potential impact of social movements on electoral politics. We test the impact of protest during the Trump presidency on the 2020 election. We hypothesize that protests, both in opposition and in support of President Trump are likely to be associated with increasing voter participation and shape partisan voting patterns. To test these hypotheses, we use data collected from media accounts of protests, official election returns, combined with demographic and political control measures. Most important, we find strong evidence that anti-Trump protests are associated with county-level shifts in the percentage of Democratic voters. This effect is much greater in Republican counties, and these patterns suggest that protest helps to shift the composition of the electorate. We also find evidence of an increase in Democratic votes cast associated with anti-Trump protests in Republican counties, and a decrease in Republican votes cast associated with anti-Trump protests in Democratic counties. We find no evidence that pro-Trump protest increased Republican turnout or vote share. '''
